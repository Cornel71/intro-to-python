## Set up instructions
### 1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python.

Follow [these instructions] (https://github.com/ariannedee/python-ide?tab=readme-ov-file#1-installing-python)
if you need additional help installing or running Python on your computer.

### 2. Download PyCharm
Download PyCharm Unified here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Install, open, and use the default settings.

### 3. Download the course files

#### If you have git installed:
Clone the repository from the URL in the "< > Code"

#### If you don't know git:
1. Click the green "< > Code" button at the top-right of the page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it and move the **intro-to-python-main** folder to a convenient location

### 4. Make sure that you can run Python in PyCharm
1. Open PyCharm (skip any configuration/tip windows)
   
2. Navigate to the **intro-to-python-main** folder and click **Open**

3. You should now have PyCharm open with the folder structure in the side panel on the left
   
4. In the left panel, navigate to `Examples/example_1_first_code.py` and double-click to open it in the editor

5. On the open file, right-click and select **Run 'example_1_first_code'**

6. In the Run tab on the bottom, you should see
`Process finished with exit code 0`

7. Otherwise, if you got an error (exit code 1 in red), follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ariannedee/python-ide/blob/main/docs/PYTHON-IDE.md/#pycharm)
for setting your Python version in PyCharm.

## FAQs

### Can I use a different code editor besides PyCharm?

Yes, but it is only recommended if you already know it and are comfortable navigating to different files and running commands in the command line. 
If it has syntax highlighting for Python, that is ideal.

If you are using VS Code, please install the Python extension.

### PyCharm can't find Python 3

Follow the instructions for [Python interpreter setup](https://github.com/ariannedee/python-ide/blob/main/docs/PYTHON-IDE.md/#pycharm).
